  Ingredientdescription: "An impossibly delicate and luminous plant known for its
    ability to produce water and nourish nearby flora. Despite its beauty, Angel\u2019s
    Tears has no sense of self-preservation and will willingly drain its own life
    essence to sustain others. The water it produces holds potent healing properties,
    making the plant a prized\u2014though heartbreakingly selfless\u2014ingredient
    among alchemists."
