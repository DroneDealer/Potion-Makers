  Ingredientdescription: This rare crystal is thought to have originated from a rogue
    asteroid that crashed to Earth under unknown influence. Strangely alive, it begins
    to transform exactly 13 hours after human contact, enclosing itself in a rough
    cocoon and reemerging one lunar cycle later as a radiant azure gem. Sought by
    potioneers for its powerful change-inducing properties, its unpredictable nature
    makes it both precious and dangerous.
