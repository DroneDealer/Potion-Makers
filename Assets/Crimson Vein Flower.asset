  Ingredientdescription: "A sentient, unsettling plant organ with red vein-like filaments
    running through its fleshy petals, resembling bloodshot eyes. It doesn't just
    see \u2014 it perceives. Its presence induces hallucinations, altered awareness,
    and distorted truths. Alchemists debate whether it\u2019s a plant, parasite,
    or something in between. Often used in potions that deal with vision, illusion,
    or unraveling the psyche."
