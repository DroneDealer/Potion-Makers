  Ingredientdescription: A relatively new biological devlopment, the Blightcap mushroom
    is a hardy, silvercapped mushroom with a faintly glowing green underside. It
    emits very faint radiation and is found growing near nuclear testing sites. These
    mushrooms remain the only organism to thrive in a radiactive environment due
    to their exceptionally sturdy structure.
