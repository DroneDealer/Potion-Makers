  Ingredientdescription: "Also known as Hell\u2019s Olive Branch, this rare blossom
    grows only in the scorched, volcanic depths of the earth where nothing else dares
    to bloom. Despite its hellish origin, the Nether Rose radiates a gentle, enduring
    warmth \u2014 a symbol of unlikely refuge. It is prized for its restorative heat,
    often used to ward off frostbite, comfort the dying, or anchor souls drifting
    toward the void. Alchemists regard it as a paradox: born of fire, yet full of
    compassion."
