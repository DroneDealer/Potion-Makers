      Vein Flower\u2019s dream-warping visions to create illusions so vivid, the

      in truth, few desperate enough to summon such hope ever fully realize that
      ideal."

    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: Due to the weak radioactive emissions from the Blightcap muhsroom,
      the magical properties of the clover have been altered and reversed - instead
      of bringing luck and joy, the potion tips the scales away from your favor.
      Must be injected into the bloodsteam (preferably the head) to take effect on
      the victim.

    potionName: Memory Fog
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: "A bittersweet blend of Angel\u2019s Tears and the corrupting
      touch of the Blightcap Mushroom, this potion clouds the mind in a gentle haze.
      It dulls painful memories and numbs grief, offering relief from trauma\u2014but
      at the cost of slipping moments and forgotten details. Use with caution, for
      forgetting may come easier than intended."

    potionName: Riftshocker
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: ' The unsavory combination of two incredibly unstable ingredients
      of unnatural origin inevitably causes a hole to rip in the space - time continuum.
      Be warned: the drinker may be transported to another dimension, be thrown backwards
      in time, be caught in a space - time loop, or may simply explode due to an
      imbalance in cosmic forces. NEVER CREATE INTENTIONALLY WITHOUT A SENIOR SPACETIME
      TRAVELLER PRESENT AND PREPARED.'

    potionName: Hollowed Charm
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: "Quite unexpected for two remarkably helpful ingredients,
      this potion produces an aura of trust that deceives rather than heals. Often
      used by politicians and silver-tongued opportunists, it draws people in\u2014regardless
      of whether that trust is deserved."

    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: "Emits poisonous, hallucination-inducing spores when uncapped
      and spread. The nature of these hallucinations appears to be shaped by the
      victim\u2019s inner conflicts as well as glimpses of their future \u2014 quite
      a fascinating property. Useful for defense and weakening foes."

    potionName: Fickle Fortuna
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: "An unstable fusion of subtle luck and living transformation
      magic. This potion attempts to mold the drinker into their \u201Cluckiest form\u201D...
      but luck is fickle. Results vary wildly, from temporary wings to jelly legs,
      extra knees, or the occasional third elbow. The form is rarely useful. Sometimes
      edible.\nIt has earned the unofficial nickname Crumblebrew, after the first
      known test subject\u2019s bones destabilized and their head was replaced with
      what witnesses insist was a giant cracker. It is still debated to this day
      whether or not the cracker was rye- or water- based."

    potionName: Seed of Truth
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: "A quiet but jarring potion brewed from overlooked potential
      and unblinking self-perception. Upon drinking, you see the truth of who you
      are\u2014not in dreams, but in total clarity. Strengths you ignored. Flaws
      you excused. Some are inspired. Others run. The potion never lies\u2026 but
      it never softens, either."

    potionName: Angel's Star
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: "Forged from healing sacrifice and celestial change, this
      potion grants the power to transfigure into another form\u2014held flawlessly
      for one day and one night, then undone as if it were never real."

    potionName: Vigil's Mercy
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: "When the healing power of Angel\u2019s Tears meets the unblinking
      sentience of the Crimson Vein, the result is a potion that senses harm before
      it strikes. The drinker gains a moment of divine foresight\u2014enough to dodge
      a blade, move before the fall, or stop a cruel word before it's spoken. Rarely
      brewed. Often wasted on those who do not listen."
  - ingredientA: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3b9c7e163aa8d2644a1e7da4fb21a256, type: 2}

    potionName: Veilrend Elixir
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: "A volatile blend that warps the fabric of magic itself. Upon
      drinking, the user\u2019s sight fractures\u2014enchantments ripple and shatter
      before their eyes. For a brief time, the drinker can unravel magical effects
      by staring directly at them, but the strain causes painful migraines and unsettling
      visions of broken worlds.\nIt has earned the nickname \u201CCrimson Vein\u2019s
      Rupture\u201D for the plant that brews it, as well as the irreparable consequences
      it wreaks upon one\u2019s vision. Long after the potion\u2019s effects should
      have faded, shadows at the edges of reality glow with broken dreams and forgotten
      worlds."

    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: "Plucked from the flame-kissed thorns of the nether wilds,
      two blooms entwine to brew a balm for the battleworn. This potion carries the
      paradox of its origin \u2014 a moment of peace born from a world of fire. When
      all hope burns away, it grants a breath of calm, a sanctuary in a bottle.\n\n"

    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: "Forged from twin tears of the protectors of all, the Angel\u2019s
      Blessing binds the drinker to a solemn vow: to mend broken bodies with threads
      of their own being. Every touch heals, yet every cure comes at a painful cost
      to the drinker, as life given is life spent."

    potionName: Rotborne Elixir
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: "Brewed from two Blightcap mushrooms steeped in radioactive
      decay, this potion thrums with unnatural energy. It does not mend \u2014 it
      mutates. Those who drink it feel strength bloom from sickness, vigor from rot.
      A toxic salvation for those who dare to evolve through corruption - for those
      who are willing to watch their body rot around them for more power. DO NOT
      CONSUME: IRREPARABLY WARPS BRAIN CHEMISTRY.\r"

    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: "modified it: Brewed from a pair of perfectly average three-leaf
      clovers, this potion is nature\u2019s little prank \u2014 for all the commonness
      of its ingredients, it\u2019s filled to the brim with luck. The universe looks
      favorably upon the drinker: everything goes their way, from lost things turning
      up exactly when needed to danger stumbling over its own feet. It\u2019s said
      the clovers giggle in the brew, delighted to be mistaken for plain and excited
      to surprise the drinker with their wealth of untapped potential.\r"

    potionName: Stellar Flux Elixir
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: "Born from twin shards of cosmic stone, the Metamorphite potion
      pulses with a quiet life of its own. Forged from rocks that fell from wandering
      skies, it carries the ancient power to shift and reshape, echoing the restless
      dance of the stars. Yet beware\u2014the two living stones within vie for dominance,
      each craving the other\u2019s space to expand. Those who drink this brew may
      find their forms mutable, but risk losing parts of themselves to the insatiable
      hunger of the metamorphing essence, as if their very being is slowly absorbed
      and rewritten."

    potionName: Psychis's Prison
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: "Brewed from a pair of Crimson Vein Flowers, this potent elixir
      opens the drinker\u2019s mind to glimpses beyond the veil\u2014visions of futures
      seen and unseen, truths both dazzling and disturbing. But such power demands
      a price: the flood of endless foresight dulls the taste of life itself, trapping
      the soul in a ceaseless haze where every moment feels both known and hollow.
      To sip is to wander a labyrinth of illusions, where reality frays and the mind
      teeters on the edge of madness."
